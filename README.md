Homework 7 - Analysis

The information that our boss handed is suspicious for two reason:

When doing the mean for each salary by title, I discovered that the Staff is earning $58465 on average (almost the same as a Senior Staff), this table below prooves this:
Assistant Engineer 48564.0 Engineer 48535.0 Manager 51531.0 Senior Engineer 48507.0 Senior Staff 58550.0 Staff 58465.0 Technique Leader 48583.0

Moreover when I created a histogram bar chart, the company is expending more than double than any other healthy company, on salaries ranging $40000 - $60000 which could be interpreted as an outlier - Either the company is saving money on higher salary titles, or they are paying way too many on lower salary titles.
CONCLUSION

If data is correct and boss is not playing games to test our knowledge then changes on real life salaries most be done. According to Hadzima, once you have taken into consideration basic salary, taxes and benefits, the real costs of your higher positions employees are typically in the 1.75 to 2 times more compared with base salaries. In other words, if and employee with a title of Staff is earning $40000 then the Senior Staff most earn $80000
